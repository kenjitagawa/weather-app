# Weather

## Description

This is an extremely simple weather app that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather for a given city. It was built with Swift and SwiftUI. It was a learning exercise for SwiftUI. It is not intended to be a production app. The app requests for the location, and from there, is able to fetch the weather for your given location.
